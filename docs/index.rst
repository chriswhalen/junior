it's junior!
============

junior is a full stack web framework, powered by `Flask`_.

Flask users will find junior's interface familiar, as it integrates many popular
community projects into a single workspace. New users are encouraged to explore
Flask's documentation to learn more about its core concepts, but this won't be
mandatory, as junior presents a unique interface that's described here in this
document. All of our API components are also cross-referenced directly to their
source project's documentation.


Why a "full stack" framework?
-----------------------------

junior handles every aspect of the web application stack,
from the SQL database layer straight up to the client-side JavaScript layer.

This integrated approach helps us offer a consistent interface for the entire
application, where each aspect supports its partners; as a developer,
this can help you reduce interface code and focus on all the features
that make your software special!
